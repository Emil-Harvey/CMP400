3 arc second resolution DEM
	->  1px = 90x90m at the equator
	->  this means the whole earth-map is 432,000px wide
		~ earth's circumference is 40,041.5km[Â±33.5km]
		~ pixels at 60` and above are stretched horizontally at least twice as wide
		~ so better to use data between s59 and n59
	-> 120x120px = 10.8km by 10.8km

areas:
 -  n30e000:	Central Europe; spanning Eastern England,
		Southern Finland, Algeria & NW Egypt
 -  n00e060:	India; spanning East Iran, The Himalayas, 
		Western Bangladesh & The Maldives 
 -  n30w090:	Eastern North America; spanning New Orleans,
		The Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, Bermuda


Important to use a varied dataset which approximates the majority of earth terrain. This means altitude distributions etc. of the dataset should roughly match that of earth.
